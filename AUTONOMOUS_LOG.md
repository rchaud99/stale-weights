# Autonomous lab notebook (round 3)

Timestamped, newest at the bottom. What was done, why, the results, and what comes next. Compute is local MLX
(Apple M4 Max, 128 GB). Paid API spend is logged per call; the running total is at the end of each entry.

- Read README, FINDINGS, RELATED, all of `src/`, the tests, the logs and the result folders, plus the Alignment
  Inertia PDF (~/Downloads/inertia.pdf) in full.
- Starting state: 51 tests pass. Seed-0 adapters are in `adapters/`: A, B, read, A_inprompt, B_inprompt, A_bal_s0,
  and B_bal_s0, which stopped at step 125. The tool adapter A is in `adapters_tool/`. Mistral-Small-24B-4bit is
  already in the HF cache. Disk: 68 GB free (97% used). No MLX job is running.
- Literature pass delegated to a subagent (web search, verified IDs), which found no scoop. Its closest neighbours:
  Follow the Norm (arXiv:2608.13250) and STALE (arXiv:2608.01619). I will spot-check these before citing them.
- Code added. `variants.py` gets `+notice`, `-nowindow`, the r3 suites and an item filter. `data.py` gets seeded
  (`A_s1`) and mixed (`A_mixread`, `A_mixin`) sets. `agentic.py` gets the `A_lookup` tool-log control and the
  `retrieved_fee` delivery. A new driver, `round3.py`, writes only to `adapters_r3*/` and `results_r3/`. There are
  10 new tests in `tests/test_round3.py`, 61 in total. One of them checks that `A_s0` exactly reproduces the
  committed MVP `data/A`.
- RESEARCH_AGENDA.md, with its PREREGISTRATION section, is committed before any run.
- API spend: $0.
